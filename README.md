Each member will upload his/her script and commit necessary changes. This README.MD cantains information about the names of the members and the softwares they used. 

## ABOUT BIOINFORMATICS
Bioinformatics is a study of biology and computer science  which is concerned with the acquisition, storage, analysis, and dissemination of biological data, most often DNA and amino acid sequences. Bioinformatics uses computer programs for a variety of applications, including determining gene and protein functions, establishing evolutionary relationships, and predicting the three-dimensional shapes of proteins.
